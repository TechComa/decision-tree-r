# 🌳 Classification Decision Tree in RStudio

This project walks through building a classification decision tree in **R** using the **rpart** and **rpart.plot** libraries. We use the classic **Iris dataset** to demonstrate how to prepare data, build a model, visualize results, and evaluate accuracy with a confusion matrix.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- R & RStudio  
- rpart, rpart.plot  
- Iris dataset  

---

## 📌 Key Steps

- ✅ Loaded and explored the Iris dataset
- 🌱 Split the data into training and testing sets (70/30)
- 🌲 Trained a classification decision tree model
- 🖼️ Visualized the tree using `rpart.plot()`
- 📊 Evaluated the model using a confusion matrix and accuracy score

---

## 📈 Results

The final model achieved an **accuracy of 97.78%** on the test set.
